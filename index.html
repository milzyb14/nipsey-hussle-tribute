                <h3>Who was Nipsey?</h3>
                <p> Nipsey was a father, an entrepreneur, a rollin 60, and a Grammy award winner. Coming from a family that couldn't afford much at a young age he without seeing many options, he joined the Rollin 60s. After a trip to his fathers home land of Eritrea, Africa, his life changed and he was pushed to music.
                    In 2013 we created <strong>All Money In</strong> record label and gained attention for selling 1000 copies of his mixtape <i>Crenshaw</i> for $100. In 2018 he dropped his official debut album, <i>Victory Lap</i>. Going to number 4 on the <i>Billbord 200</i> and was nominated for best rap album. Aside from his music, his focus on black ownership, he and his brother, Blacc Sam, opened 
                    The Marathon Clothing Store. It sat right in the heart of the hood instead of far from the streets that gave him his grind. While donating clothes to people who needed them he also hired parolees to work in the store. Giving people an opportunity he never had growing up. Going on to try to bridge a gap in communications with the LADP and open up an opportunity for the people of Crenshaw and LAPD to begin dialogue on 
                    what they could do to make the streets better, he was unfortunately a victim of gun violence the day before he was supposed to have the meeting with LAPD. After a seemingly cordial conversation between Eric Holder JR. and Nipsey, about the consequences of "cooperating with the police", Eric returned with a gun and firing shots up close at nipsey which ultimately killed him. After being rushed to the hospital alongside Kerry Lathan (who sustained a gun shot wound to the spine), 
                    Airmess Joseph Asghedom better know as Nipsey Hussle was pronounced dead at 3:55pm on march 31st, 2019.

                <h3>An Inspiration to myself and many</h3>
                <p>Nipsey Hussle was an inspiration to many people around the world, especially young black men. He stood for something other than just exploiting his past. He stood for he neighborhood and his people. He tried to make changes to the environment he and many other people live in. He was transparent
                    about his gang involvement all the way to his entrepreneurial efforts. He started businesses owned by him and gave people opportunities that had virtually none. He promoted black ownership and "buying back the block", hard work and dedication. Even owning his own music and not allowing record labels to control him. 
                    Nipsey is an inspiration to me because his music and lyrics speak of hard times and transcending through those times with hard work, focus, and ultimately black ownership. I think more black people including myself to ownership and assets, instead were marketed substance abuse and materialism. We need more role models 
                    that show us, especially young men, how to navigate life and how to build for ourselves.
